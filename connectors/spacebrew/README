Instructions
------------

(We are assuming Spacebrew is running, and you have the MuseIO SDK installed. If not, do these things first.)

% bundle install
% bundle exec ruby muse_osc_spacebrew_bridge.rb

Using a web browser, visit http://spacebrew.github.io/spacebrew/admin/admin.html?server=localhost

- You should see 'muse' listed under Clients, with two Publishers ( concentration and mellow )

In another terminal...

% muse-io --osc osc.udp://localhost:9090

Now pair with the Muse headset!

Go back to your web browser. The dot to the left of the publisher should be blinking wildly. This is data!!!
